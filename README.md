# Machine Learning Project: Predicting and Classifying Paint Color Trends  

## Overview  
This project leverages exclusive data provided by **PPG Industries**, a global leader in paints and coatings. Using machine learning techniques, the project analyzes PPG's extensive library of paint colors to uncover patterns associated with top-selling paint products and the factors influencing their success.  

## Objectives  
1. **Regression Analysis**:  
   - Predict key paint properties based on PPG's proprietary color model inputs.  
   - Identify the most influential inputs for predicting paint characteristics.  

2. **Classification Task**:  
   - Classify whether a paint belongs to PPG's popular products category based on color model inputs.  
   - Evaluate the impact of these inputs on product popularity.  

## Tools and Techniques  
- **Programming Language**: R  
- **Regression Models**:  
  - Linear models with interaction terms and non-linear basis functions.  
  - Feature engineering to explore relationships between categorical and continuous variables.  

- **Classification Models**:  
  - Generalized Linear Models (GLM)  
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
  - Na√Øve Bayes  
  - Generalized Additive Models (GAM)  

- **Data Visualization and Analysis**: ggplot2, dplyr (EDA and results visualization)  

## Data Source  
The dataset used in this project is **proprietary to PPG Industries**, offering exclusive insights into their paint color library and sales trends.  

## Key Results  
- Improved prediction accuracy for critical paint properties through non-linear transformations and interaction terms.  
- Enhanced classification performance in identifying popular paint products using machine learning models.  

## Future Scope  
The findings can support PPG in developing recommendation systems to help users select paints based on preferences or global trends, enhancing both customer experience and business outcomes.
